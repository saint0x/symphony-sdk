# Symphony Runtime Refactor Plan

> **Strategic Refactor - December 2024**  
> **Goal**: Transform current agent execution into sophisticated agentic runtime  
> **Approach**: Preserve "magic" tool execution + Add conversation-first experience + Enhanced planning/reflection

## 🎯 **CORE VISION**

### **Current State (Working but Limited)**
- Single-shot LLM execution with tool calling
- "Magic" unconscious tool execution (brilliant design)
- Effective but lacks conversation and multi-step planning

### **Target State (Sophisticated Agentic Runtime)**
- **Preserve**: Unconscious tool execution brilliance
- **Add**: Natural conversation throughout task execution
- **Enhance**: Multi-step planning with reflection and adaptation
- **Integrate**: Deep Context Intelligence API integration

## 🏗️ **PRODUCTION ARCHITECTURE (LEAN & FOCUSED)**

### **Core Runtime Components**
```
src/runtime/
├── SymphonyRuntime.ts              # Main orchestrator
├── RuntimeContext.ts               # Execution state management  
├── RuntimeTypes.ts                 # Core type definitions
│
└── engines/
    ├── ExecutionEngine.ts          # Core "magic" tool execution logic
    ├── ConversationEngine.ts       # Manages chat flow and response generation
    ├── PlanningEngine.ts           # Decomposes tasks into steps
    └── ReflectionEngine.ts         # Analyzes results and suggests corrections
```
> **CTO Note:** We've eliminated the excessive sub-folders (`/context`, `/planning`, etc.). Each engine is responsible for its own internal logic. This is a cleaner, more direct architecture that avoids over-engineering.

## ✅ **PHASE 1: FOUNDATION & SAFE MIGRATION** (Days 1-3)

### **Day 1: Core Runtime Structure (COMPLETE)**

#### **Create SymphonyRuntime.ts**
- [x] Main orchestrator class with engine composition
- [x] Legacy compatibility mode (exact current behavior)
- [x] Enhanced execution mode (conversation + planning)
- [x] Feature flag support for gradual rollout
- [x] Proper dependency injection of existing services

**Key Files Created:**
- [x] `src/runtime/SymphonyRuntime.ts`
- [x] `src/runtime/RuntimeContext.ts` 
- [x] `src/runtime/RuntimeTypes.ts`

**Implementation:**
```typescript
// src/runtime/SymphonyRuntime.ts
export class SymphonyRuntime {
    constructor(
        private toolRegistry: ToolRegistry,
        private contextAPI: IContextAPI,
        private llmHandler: LLMHandler,
        private logger: Logger
    ) {
        // Initialize engines
    }
    
    async executeLegacy(task: string, agentConfig: AgentConfig): Promise<ToolResult>
    async execute(task: string, agentConfig: AgentConfig): Promise<RuntimeResult>
}
```
> **Side Quest Complete:** Refactored the entire `ContextIntelligenceAPI` into a type-safe `ContextAPI` with a `useMagic()` method. This provides a cleaner, more robust interface for all agent intelligence.

#### **Validation Checkpoint Day 1:**
- [x] SymphonyRuntime instantiates without errors
- [x] All existing services inject properly
- [x] Basic structure compiles and imports work
- [x] Build is 100% clean with zero TypeScript errors.

### **Day 2: Execution Engine (COMPLETE)**

**Implementation Features:**
- [x] Natural opening responses for tasks.

- [x] The engine formulates dynamic queries for `ponderTool` based on step success or failure.
- [x] It translates the output from `ponderTool` into a structured `Reflection` object.
- [x] A basic fallback reflection is created if the `ponderTool` fails.

**Key Files Created:**
- [x] `src/runtime/engines/ReflectionEngine.ts`

**Reflection Capabilities:**
- [x] Assesses step execution quality by leveraging a cognitive tool.
- [x] Suggests a concrete next action (`continue`, `abort`, etc.) based on deep analysis.
- [x] The `SymphonyRuntime` is now self-aware, reflecting after each step.

#### **Validation Checkpoint Day 6:**
- [x] `ReflectionEngine` is fully integrated into the `SymphonyRuntime`'s execution loop.
- [x] The `ponderTool` is correctly called with a context-aware query.
- [x] The runtime can abort a plan based on the reflection's suggestion.
