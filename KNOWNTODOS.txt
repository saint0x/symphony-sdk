- std tools vec to pass in, maybe also via registry, so no hardcoded into prompt for llm awareness

- respondtouser api for cli feedback

- /fixnlptable.md

- test script for when llm uses a tool but pattern match was incorrect (should negatively update cmd map)

- actually apply to CONTEXT.json???
